# CATEGORY THEORY 
Monoidal categories: 
    if have an arrow: A -> B and B->C 
    => have composite: A -> C 
    => axioms: whenever CODOMAIN(output domain) of 1 arrow matches the DOMAIN(input domain) of another arrow -> can compose them => SEQUENTIAL COMPOSITION 

    Have other COMPOSITIONS as well: (depends on the Category)
    vd: Have category D: all binary products
        => have PARALLEL COMPOSITION
