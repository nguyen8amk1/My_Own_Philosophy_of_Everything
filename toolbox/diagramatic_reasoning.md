# DIAGRAMATIC REASONING

State machine:  
    + What TYPE of TOOL is this ?
        ....
    + What the REASON it created ? 
        ....
        -> the kind of problems they best suited 
    + How to USE it ? 
        ....
    + What makes it UNIQUE ? 
        ....
        -> understanding the: 
            + capabilities 
            + constraints 
            -> help you pick the right tool for the job 

    NOTE: 
        Should focus on State rather than Transition
            -> The transition is stem from State 
            rather than the State stem from Transition
