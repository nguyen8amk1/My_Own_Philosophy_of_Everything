## SELECTION TOOL 
    6 types of selection: 
        Rectangle 
        Elipse  
        Free Select 
            by clicking different points to form a CLOSED LOOP
        Sissor selection: 
            It's like free select but instead of straight line, it's try to eastimate the content and follow the pixels
        Fuzzy selection: 

        Color select: 

    Feature: 
        + Can edit things only in the selection (brushing, color adjust,...)
        + Can have MULTIPLE SELECTION when holding the <shift> key while creating selection
        + BOOLEAN OPERATIONS with different selection region: 
            + Add 
            + Subtract
            + Intersect 
            -> Can toggle between them with shift, ctrl,...

        + Ctrl c to COPY THE IMAGE IN THE SELECTION and paste it to another image. 

## NOTE:     
    Each tool have different modes -> with different features 
        vd: boolean operations, ... 

    -> in the TOOLS OPTIONS box 

## LAYERS
    Create new layer from selection (is not as straight forward as PTS)
        copy the content in the selection         
        paste (ctrl  v) 
            -> it will generate a "floating something" 
        click create layer from ... in the bottom of the stack 

## CROP AND MOVE TOOLS 
    Crop: 
        Hold control to scale relative to the center
    Move tool: 
        Can move either: 
            + layer 
            + selection 
            + path 

    If you want to CROP just the SELECTED LAYER -> Have to CHOOSE specific OPTION

## ROTATE AND SCALE
