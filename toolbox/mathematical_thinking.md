# MATHEMATICAL THINKING
learning from this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LN7cCW1rSsI 

Stresses on the:
   + HOW 
   + WHY 
    -> you get to the right answer 
    rather than just matching a problem to a defined form (since that won't work most of the time in the real world)

Background reading: 
    Mathematic is the science of patterns 
        vd: 
            Arithmetic and number theory: PATTERNS of NUMBER and COUNTING
            Geometric: patterns of shape 
            Calculus: patterns of motion 
            Logic: patterns of reasoning 
            Probability: patterns of chances 

    Mathematical notation is just a REPRESENTATION of math, it's not the Mathematic itself:
        it's like MUSIC SHEET is NOT MUSIC  
            -> the sound that played from that sheet is Music 
        -> IT'S ABOUT THE EXECUTATION OF THE REPRESENTATION 

        -> Mathematic use abstract notation because of the ABSTRACT NATURE of the patterns 
            -> it's the best mean to represent math, that's it 

    Mathematic is not just about computation/calculation
    but it more about:
        + properties 
        + behaviours
        vd: a function is not a formula
           -> it's any rules that produces new number from old  
           -> concernstrate on WHAT THE FUNCTION DOES ? in terms of: input, output behaviours

    Prepare for MENTAL TOOLS for entering and thinking mathematically 

    There are 2 types of mathematical skills: 
        1. get an already formulated problem, find solution
        2. take a new problem:
            identify and describe key features of the problem mathematically  
            use that mathematical description to analyze the problem in a precise fashion

        the 2nd type is better, way more powerful
