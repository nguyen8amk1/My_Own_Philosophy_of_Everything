## WINDOW MANAGER - I3 
    ... 
    -> Basically separate the viewport for different tasks 
    which you can alter between with a single keystroke
    rather than alt-tabbing all the time. 
    vd: alt-1 for browsing, alt-2 for work

    -> it's all ways stay that same way,
    everything will be way faster when you work systematically

    -> Use for different "GUI purpose" ?? 
    -> Better words: Dividing your Desktop Environment into workspaces 

    Can: 
        Config the thing so that when you boot the machine up, 
        everything you need will be just in place  
        All the workspace is just right there :v

## TERMINAL MULTIPLEXER - TMUX
    ...
    -> still not understand very well :v 

    -> allow closing the terminal without killing the working sessions
        vd: nodejs server is running, code working,...  
        -> just reattach the tmux with session and everything will be fine.

    Tmux session would be really good for web development: 
        since there are so many services that you have to work simutanously
