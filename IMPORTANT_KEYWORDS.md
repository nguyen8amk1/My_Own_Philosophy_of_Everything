    ABSTRACT: 
        ....

	PARAMETERIZE:  
        this is the idea where you go from concrete to abstract
        if you already have/implement a concrete solution and now you want to abstract it  
        -> WRAP IT IN A BOX with some parameter sticking out
        try to paramterize it  
        use it as a black box with some input sticking out 

        -> this also applies to parametric design 
            -> design a concrete structure  
            -> parameterize some of the aspect of the structure to create a dynamic structure with different combination of measurements
