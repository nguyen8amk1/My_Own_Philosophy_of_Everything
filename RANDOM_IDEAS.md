# RANDOM IDEAS 
1. A Wikipeadia-like page to store all of these philosophies 
    -> have all the features of normal wiki, but only for my usage 
    -> convert the markdown(readme) format to wiki format (or just render the markdown file) 

2. Create a web app that can help your self improvement journey 
    Create a KNOWLEDGE GRAPH out of your diary ?? 
        diary with some specific syntax of course 
        -> Later we can use a GPT MODEL to PARSE HUMAN DIARY into our DIARY LANGUAGE  

    + KNOWLEDGE GRAPH OF YOUR: 
        + pros 
        + cons   

        -> Generate(with your guidance maybe ??) a MASTER STRATEGY to 
            + BUFF your PROS  
            + NERF your CONS

    + Extracts your SPIDER GRAPH of DIFFERENT ASPECT of your
        -> CREATE PLANS to accomodate that 

    with a bunch of researches of course 
    -> Auto generate the Wikipeadia-like page in the 1.

    + Have a history representation in some ways
        knowledge history 
        emotion history ?? 
        ...  

    + HEALTH MODELING: 
        this app is originally about storing and visualizing your knowledge, brain function  
        NOW WE EXTEND IT INTO YOUR WHOLE BODY 
        ** there are so many information could be included in your diary   
        -> Just modeling your entire health and stuff into there 
        EMOTION Modeling ?? 

    -> the OVERALL IDEAS of the program is to: 
        Visualize and Analyze CONCRETELY 
        your CURRENT STATE of MENTAL and HEATLH 

    + Mental and Health SHARING ?? 
        WITH some RESTRICTIONS of course 

    ***TODO: 
        -> may be do a few notes on how the diary format should be 
        (actually til this point (11/19/2023) we don't even know how the KNOWLEDGE REPRESENTATION should be,
        so things are still very vauge)
        since it would be a heck of an effort to trying to port all of these current notes into our new system 

        "At the beginning it was paper, 
        then it was markdown 
        and finally it's diary in a virtual brain"

    QUESTIONS: 
        Should i use Notion for references ? 
        Did my idea is even close to Notion ??
