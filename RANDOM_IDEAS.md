# RANDOM IDEAS 
1. A Wikipeadia-like page to store all of these philosophies 
    -> have all the features of normal wiki, but only for my usage 
    -> convert the markdown(readme) format to wiki format (or just render the markdown file) 

2. Create a web app that can help your self improvement journey 
    Create a KNOWLEDGE GRAPH out of your diary ?? 
        diary with some specific syntax of course 
        -> Later we can use a GPT MODEL to PARSE HUMAN DIARY into our DIARY LANGUAGE  

    + KNOWLEDGE GRAPH OF YOUR: 
        + pros 
        + cons   

        -> Generate(with your guidance maybe ??) a MASTER STRATEGY to 
            + BUFF your PROS  
            + NERF your CONS

    + Extracts your SPIDER GRAPH of DIFFERENT ASPECT of your
        -> CREATE PLANS to accomodate that 

    with a bunch of researches of course 
    -> Auto generate the Wikipeadia-like page in the 1.

    + Have a history representation in some ways
        knowledge history 
        emotion history ?? 
        ...  

    + HEALTH MODELING: 
        this app is originally about storing and visualizing your knowledge, brain function  
        NOW WE EXTEND IT INTO YOUR WHOLE BODY 
        ** there are so many information could be included in your diary   
        -> Just modeling your entire health and stuff into there 
        EMOTION Modeling ?? 

    -> the OVERALL IDEAS of the program is to: 
        Visualize and Analyze CONCRETELY 
        your CURRENT STATE of MENTAL and HEATLH 

    + Mental and Health SHARING ?? 
        WITH some RESTRICTIONS of course 

    + A REALLY COOL FEATURE: 
        Your logical brain is on the computer 
        which means you can communicate to yourself with all of those knowledge on how to to deciding things 
        -> ACTUALLY COMMUNICATE TO YOURSELF, asking, communicating, or certain things

        BUT the most BASIC and possible feature would be: 
            FUZZY FINDING through the brain knowledge 
            Input: some questions/query -> vd: How to choose between A and B?   
            Output: the search result of the page that "relate" to that input  
            
            -> GOOGLE SEARCH BUT THE RESULT ARE ONLY THE ONES YOU HAVE ALREADY KNOW :V (somewhere inside your virtual brain)

    + Diary writing might be the KEY TO SCALE this platform, 
        instead of strict markdown format 
        know we have gpt model which can understand the content and do some processing on it 

        -> We can actually have a interconnected knowledge tree that people can share their mental status and health through diary writing 
        -> Matching people with:
                + the same brain ?? 
                + opposite SPIDER GRAPH ?? 
                -> they can compensate each other weaknesses 

        -> DATING APP: 
            based on THEIR SPIDER GRAPH 
            -> HIGH IQ DATING APP ?? 

    + Tat xau input:  
        Create a knowledge graph of tat xau 
            -> inform you which of them to eliminate first 

    + Remind "important" long time no touch Topic 

    + Category and Related Topic ??  
        among: 
            + your own knowledge ?? 
            + sharing friends knowledge ?? 

    ***TODO: 
        -> may be do a few notes on how the diary format should be 
        (actually til this point (11/19/2023) we don't even know how the KNOWLEDGE REPRESENTATION should be,
        so things are still very vauge)
        since it would be a heck of an effort to trying to port all of these current notes into our new system 

        "At the beginning it was paper, 
        then it was markdown 
        and finally it's diary in a virtual brain"

    + Finantial Management ?? 
        Big problem: 
            how could i track my spending without actually manually input into the program ?? 

            -> May be have an middleware app on phone that tracks all the transaction of you 
            but not actually label the transaction 
            the labeling will be done manually at the end of the day by human 

    ** HELP YOU STICK WITH YOUR "ĐẠO" when you're the most vulnerable 

    NOTE: 
        I really should document the process of bulding this platform using the ealier version of the platform 

    QUESTIONS: 
        Should i use Notion for references ? 
        Did my idea is even close to Notion ?? 
    


3. UNO Reverse card (THIS IDEA IS PRETTY CONCRETE, NOT RANDOM AT ALL)
    each card have 2 sides: 
        + OPPOTUNITY 
        + PROBLEM 
        the back comes from the front one (which ever can be the front one) 

        vd: 
            If you Write the down the oppotunity first  
            then Write the problem stems from the oppotunity 
            and the opposite 
        
    -> BASICALLY JUST PROS and CONS cards, 
        but the main goal is remember: 
            "Any PROBLEM stems OPPOTUNITIES, and the opposite"

    -> BASICALLY IT'S SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Oppotunities, Threats), but just the OT :v
