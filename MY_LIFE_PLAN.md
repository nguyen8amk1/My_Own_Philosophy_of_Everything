# MY LIFE PLAN: 
heading format: 
    date: YYYY-MM-DD
    <date > - <title> 

NOTE: 
    I have to do fresher in the summer 
        -> i have 6 months left 
    After done doing fresher: 
        i have a 7th semester to keep learning ?? 

Ideal Timeline: 
    6th Semester(very busy preparing for CV, ) -> Fresher (summer)-> 7th Semester (Preparing for leaving school)
    -> 8th Semester (already out of school)
    -> Total time left: 4 + 2 + 4  = 10 months left (to be out of school)

Backup Timeline (in case i CAN'T FIND FRESHER IN SUMMER): 
    6th Semester(very busy preparing for CV) -> Can't find Fresher (summer)-> 7th Semester (Doing fresher)
    -> 8th Semester (Preparing for leaving school)
    -> Total time left: 4 + 2 + 4  = 10 months left (to be out of school)

-> TOP PRIORITY: 
    FRESHER (spend the whole 6h Semester for preparing the interview (knowledge, projects, CV) -> only 4 months left :)) ) 
    -> I may have to REMOVE SOME OF THE SUBJECTS (at school) to make things lighter for me the to prepare the CV

TODO: 
    CV oriented: i might have to stop reading too many books in order to focus on finishing the things that should be done.
    After having a solid plan: 
        -> stop anything that is unrelated to the overall plan 
        -> JUST FOCUS ON FINISHING THE PLAN AS FAST AS POSSIBLE :))
