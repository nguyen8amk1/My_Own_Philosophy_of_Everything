RANDOM QUOTES (that should be added to some topic):
    ***You only USE something(tool) when you need its BENEFITS
        -> Not use it just because you can use it, or other tell you to ...

    Things in life happens in (solution) pattern, a lot of patterns applies to almost every aspect of our lives (economics, decisions, coding, math, ...)
        -> learning general patterns can help you solve most of the problems in most aspect of life
        -> a good language to learning these patterns is Mathematics
        -> Mathematics give you: 
            + an abstract representation of the patterns 
            + the tools:
                + to prove the correctness of the patterns 
                + to predicts the outcome of the patterns
                + to create new patterns 
                + to check the similarity between different fields then apply the same pattern to solve them (Category theory ??)
        -> Able to ABSTRACTLY RECOGINIZE PATTERNS is one of the most powerful things ever (along with all the tools/operations you can apply to the patterns (deduce new patterns, ...))

    -> Question: 
        -> WHAT ARE THE PROPERTIES THAT WE CAN USE TO IDENTIFY PATTERNS ? 
            vd: the similarity of the rules of managing between finantial portfolio and technical portfolio is almost 1 to 1 
            ....

        -> HOW TO ABSTRACT IT THE CONCRETE PATTERNS INTO GENERAL PATTERNS ? 
            ....

        -> HOW TO PROVE THAT THE ABSTRACT PATTERN IS APPLICABLE TO SOME RANDOM FIELDS ? (Mathematically?)
            ....

        -> Does category theory is the answers to all of these questions ?? 
            Category theory is more about how we structure knowledge rather than how knowledge actually are,
            focus on relation (morphism), not content (object)  
            ->  prove things using relation between them so the actual object does not matter 
                as long as the foundation relationship between them holds  
            ....

    THE PROCESS OF FULLY UNDERSTAND ANYTHING:
        If you keep using the [criteria of concepts](./frameworks//things_you_need_to_know_before_choosing_tools.md) on things you wanted to learn:
            an keep running down the rabbit hole: 
                vd: you disect concepts A into: 
                    it's:
                        Type: B
                        Unique Features: C
                        How to use it: D 
                    -> Each will be come a concepts on its own 
                        -> RECURSIVELY GO DOWN THE RABBIT HOLE 
            -> [good enough mindset](./frameworks/good_enough_philosophy.md) is a must to get anything done on time
                -> since it give you a STOPPING POINT at digging to actually REST and USE the gained concepts 

    THE SKILL TO GETTING THINGS DONE WITHOUT KNOWING ALL THE DETAILS OF THE SYSTEM YOU ARE CURRENTING WORKING ON:
        vd: You already know CONCEPTUALLY how to solve the problem 
            -> the problem abstractly solved using math or something like that 

        -> now only need to implement it into the real-world :)) 

        BUT, to implement it in the real world is NOT very STRAIGHT-FORWARD 
        since you need an environment that match the mathematical model (abstract environment) that you use to solve the problem in 

        -> there a lot of setup when cause things are get in the way 
        -> So the setting up part is not needed to remember, they are just preparation

        -> The core is already in your head 

        -> SOLVE THE PROBLEM CONCEPTUALLY, IMPLEMENTATION IS NOW JUST DRUDG WORK

        vd: you already now how to move a circle according to time
            -> you can do that in any language(js, node, java,...), environment(web canvas, DOM, desktop, ...)
