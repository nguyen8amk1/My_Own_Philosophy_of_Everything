    LEARN HOW TO DECIDE (HOW TO BE DECISIVE): 
        This is right up the hardest thing i've ever wanted to learn  
        and still can't do it right 
        Really want to know how to be a decisive person ?? 
            -> What i TRULY WANT are:
                + Learn to admit the problem with my decision 
                + Learn to actually decide the thing that good on the whole, not just me 
                    (i tend to delay the decision so that i could wait for the timing that beneficial on my part only) -> The reason why i become indecisive -> Selfish TT
                -> These thing should become INSTINCE

    [HOW TO LEARN A NEW PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE (Deduce from 7L7W)](./frameworks/learn_new_programming_languages.md) 
        <insert an introduction> 

    LEARN HOW TO SWITCH BETWEEN ABSTRACT AND CONCRETE MINDSET: 
        Abstract thinking: 
            helps you to see the similarity between phenomenons  

        Concrete thinking: 
            helps you to see the differences between phenomenons  
            
        -> You need both thinking to be a good problem solver 

        My problem is that:     
            i saw the world too abstractly sometimes -> i can't remember the details, just vauge objects instead ?

        My strengths: 

        Strategy: 
            Divide the problem: 
                Divide the problem into discrete sub problems (steps)
                ....
                
            Reduce the problem: 
                Remove some contraints in oreder to make the (divided) problem easier to solve 
                ....
        ....
