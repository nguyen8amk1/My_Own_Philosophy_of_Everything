MY FRAMEWORKS: 
    THINGS YOU NEED TO KNOW BEFORE CHOOSING AMONG TOOLS (DEDUCE FROM 7DB7W): 
        Learn to make choice given:
            + particular needs  
            + resource at hand 
                understand your options: 
                    -> good, bad options 
                    -> Gets your hand dirty to figure out these questions -> understand the options
                        + What TYPE of TOOL is this ?
                        + What the REASON it created ? 
                            -> the kind of problems they best suited 
                        + How to USE it ? 
                        + What makes it UNIQUE ? 
                            -> understanding the: 
                                + capabilities 
                                + constraints 
                                -> help you pick the right tool for the job 

        The questions to ask is: 
            Should i use this to ... ?
            not Can i ....
            -> the questions is less about the solutions is complete fit with your problem
                but rather it's the best fit given your:
                    + problem space
                    + usage pattern 
                    + available resources 

        Instead of pure dominance of any particular strategy: 
            -> we'll see increasingly SPECIALIZED SOLUTION
            -> each suited for a particular (can be overlapped) SET OF IDEAL PROBLEM SPACE 

        -> @TEST: USE THIS FRAMEWORK TO UNDERSTAND THE NATURE DATA STRUCTURES AND ALGORITHMS 

    GOOD ENOUGH PHILOSOPHY: 
        One of the best(hardest) skills you can ever learn: 
            KNOW WHEN TO STOP: 
                There is a threshold for digging into a rabbit hole 
                But the finding value of the threshold is the problem 
                    -> You can't really found the sweet spot without getting your hands dirty  
                    -> Need a lot of try and error to get it right 
                Digging a knowledge too deep could actually hurt your learning process rather than improving it   
                -> GOOD ENOUGH IS THE STATE THAT YOU DON'T ACTUALLY KNOW ALL THE INS AND OUTS OF THE KNOWLEDGE BUT YOU CAN STILL BENEFIT FROM IT, YOU CAN TRY TO DIG DEEPER AT OTHER TIME  
                -> The threshold best value is the "good enough" 

        Things won't be perfect given the time and technology we currently having 
        Use the thing that is a cut-down version rather than waiting for a perfect to come 
        -> Try to apply the current knowledge 
            (even though it's not perfect match for everything or even well thought out -> know when the stop researching and actually use the knowledge) 
            then refines it afterwards (involve the users in the trade-offs)
