            -> This does have formulation and stuff, so probably watch this first 


    + Objective function:

Linear programming vs (Mix) Integer Programming: ?? 
    Differences:  
        LP: variables are real numbers -> continous
        IP: variables are integers -> discrete 

They are:
    + Decision-making framework:
    + Proof of optimality 
        -> they have built in functionality to PROOF the OPTIMISM of decision
    + Common language for mathematical modeling: 

NOTE: 
    EQUATIONs = CONSTRAINTs

They(LP, IP) can: 
    solve system with MORE EQUATIONS/CONTRAINTS than UNKNOWNS 
        -> which matrix can't do 
    -> MORE EQUATIONS THAN UNKNOWNS MEANS there are unlimited solutions to the problem  
    -> But matrix can't find the optimal one from those 
    -> BUT LP and IP CAN -> FIND THE OPTIMAL SOLUTION IN THE VAST SET OF SOLUTIONS
