# HOW TO LEARN A NEW PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE (Deduce from 7L7W): 

*Knowing multiple paradigm greatly improve your design skill 

Getting started with a language is try to:
    + keep the syntax correct
    + understand the syntax error 
    + get a working program 
    -> The brain will ACTIVELY learning this 
-> NOT try to understand the core principles that the language embodied 
    -> the brain will LEARN THIS IN THE BACKGROUND rather than you try to learn it from the start
    -> one day you wake up and you will magically understand it 
NOTE: 
    Programming is about understanding of ideas
    More exposure to new ideas -> deepen the understanding of what programming is all about 

    The first language give you tools to get through everyday tasks.
    The second language help you encounter the new world. 
        -> knowing new languages SHAPE THE WAY YOU THINK 

The process: 
    Goal: experience the language in a controlled enviroment (IDE,...)
        -> some way to GET A WORKING PROGRAM AS FAST AS POSSIBLE without much fuss 
        looking for:
            + a snap shot of syntatic sugar
            + core concepts 

    Find answer to these questions: 
        + What is the TYPING MODEL?: 
            + strong (Java)
            + weak (C)
            + static (Java)
            + dynamic (Ruby)
            -> Typing model affects: 
                + the TRADE-OFF that developer have to deal with 
                + the WAY TO ATTACK THE PROBLEM 
                + control the WAY THE LANGUAGE WORKS 
        + What is the PROGRAMMING MODEL?: 
            + OOP  
            + FP 
            + Procedural 
            + Hybrid 

            -> Learning PROGRAMMING PARADIGMS is one of the MOST IMPORTANT concepts 

        + How will you INTERACT with it?: 
            -> How to get it running ? 
            -> What environment does it run in ? 
            + compiled 
            + interpreted
            + does it have VM or not ? 

        + What are the:
            + decisions constructs
                + if
                + while 
                + other constructs that way differents than what you have ever seen 
            + core data structure: 
                + collections, containers 

        + What are the CORE FEATURES that make the language UNIQUE ? 
            vd: some support: 
                + advance feature for CONCURRENT PROGRAMMING
                + unique high-level constructs: 
                    + closure macros
                    + message interpretation 
                    +...
