# HOW TO GOOGLE (WHEN LEARNING A FRAMEWORK)

In order to correctly Google some information (syntax, features) of libraries, frameworks,...  
You need these prerequisites:
    terminologies
    the approach of the library, framework, ... 
        (vd: functional based, oop based, utilitiy based: tailwind, predesigned based: bootstrap, ...)
    -> what to google = terminologies + libraries/framework approach

    vd: Tailwind have the approach of utilities composition, have the term utilities  
        -> in order to create a custom button in tailwind, 
            instead of searching for a whole button to reuse
            searching for individuals utilities that can be used to create a button 
            (since you want to create your own design and understand how tailwind works)

    -> google queries should match the overall approach of the framework
