# THINGS YOU NEED TO KNOW BEFORE CHOOSING AMONG TOOLS (DEDUCE FROM 7DB7W): 

Learn to make choice given:
    + particular needs  
    + resource at hand 
        understand your options: 
            -> good, bad options 
            -> Gets your hand dirty to figure out these questions -> understand the options
                + What TYPE of TOOL is this ?
                + What the REASON it created ? 
                    -> the kind of problems they best suited 
                + How to USE it ? 
                + What makes it UNIQUE ? 
                    -> understanding the: 
                        + capabilities 
                        + constraints 
                        -> help you pick the right tool for the job 

The questions to ask is: 
    Should i use this to ... ?
    not Can i ....
    -> the questions is LESS about the solutions is COMPLETE FIT with your problem
        but rather it's the BEST FIT given your:
            + problem space
            + usage pattern 
            + available resources 

Instead of pure dominance of any particular strategy: 
    -> we'll see increasingly SPECIALIZED SOLUTION
    -> each suited for a particular (can be overlapped) SET OF IDEAL PROBLEM SPACE
