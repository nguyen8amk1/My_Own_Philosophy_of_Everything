# PROCEDURE OF ALGORITHM ANALYSIS 
Try to apply the [Abstraction (Remove Hooks)](./how_to_learn_and_apply_concepts.md) to actually deduce a general procedure to analyse abitrary algorithms
2 types of algorithms:
    non-recursion 
    recursion 
    -> each have their own set of processes  

Non-recursion: 
    Different Concrete procedures of analysis 
        1. 
        2. 
        3. 

    -> 
        Main procedure: 
            + Boxing 
            ....


        Clearly explained the details of Objects: 
            delta_i: 
                the WORK COUNT OF THE LOOP at that specific i (cause the behaviour of delta_i is depend on i)
            range of i in sum: 
                the range of values of i that actually have delta_i works
                -> since the the whole range of i might not all fit the condition of delta_i 
                -> need to EXTRACT THE ACTUAL RANGE OF WORK 

            the count of how many i = how many times the delta_i gets called:   
                ....

            -> Extract and remember the Relation/Pattern between them: 
                Relation: 
                    ....

Recursion: 
    have 4 approaches to analyze, each have their own pros, cons:
        + ..
            pros: 
            cons: 
        + ..
            pros:
