# GOOD ENOUGH PHILOSOPHY: 

One of the best(hardest) skills you can ever learn: 
    KNOW WHEN TO STOP: 
        There is a threshold for digging into a rabbit hole 
        But the finding value of the threshold is the problem 
            -> You can't really found the sweet spot without getting your hands dirty  
            -> Need a lot of try and error to get it right 
        Digging a knowledge too deep could actually hurt your learning process rather than improving it   
        -> GOOD ENOUGH IS THE STATE THAT YOU DON'T ACTUALLY KNOW ALL THE INS AND OUTS OF THE KNOWLEDGE BUT YOU CAN STILL BENEFIT FROM IT, YOU CAN TRY TO DIG DEEPER AT OTHER TIME  
        -> The threshold best value is the "good enough" 

Things won't be perfect given the time and technology we currently having 
Use the thing that is a cut-down version rather than waiting for a perfect to come 
-> Try to apply the current knowledge 
    (even though it's not perfect match for everything or even well thought out -> know when the stop researching and actually use the knowledge) 
    then refines it afterwards (involve the users in the trade-offs) 

Questions: WHAT ARE THE PROPERTIES TO CONSIDER ? 
    -> When should you stop and call it "good enough" ?
