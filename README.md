    ABSTRACT:

	PARAMETERIZE:  
        this is the idea where you go from concrete to abstract
        if you already have/implement a concrete solution and now you want to abstract it  
        -> WRAP IT IN A BOX with some parameter sticking out
        try to paramterize it  
        use it as a black box with some input sticking out

MY FRAMEWORKS: 
    A MASTER PLAN TO SOLVE PROBLEMS (which should counter your weaknesses in problem solving):
        ....

RANDOM QUOTES (that should be added to some topic):
    Things in life happens in (solution) pattern, a lot of patterns applies to almost every aspect of our lives (economics, decisions, coding, math, ...)
        -> learning general patterns can help you solve most of the problems in most aspect of life
        -> a good language to learning these patterns is Mathematics
        -> Mathematics give you: 
            + an abstract representation of the patterns 
            + the tools:
                + to prove the correctness of the patterns 
                + to predicts the outcome of the patterns
                + to create new patterns 
                + to check the similarity between different fields then apply the same pattern to solve them (Category theory ??)
        -> Able to ABSTRACTLY RECOGINIZE PATTERNS is one of the most powerful things ever (along with all the tools/operations you can apply to the patterns (deduce new patterns, ...))

    -> Question: 
        -> WHAT ARE THE PROPERTIES THAT WE CAN USE TO IDENTIFY PATTERNS ? 
            vd: the similarity of the rules of managing between finantial portfolio and technical portfolio is almost 1 to 1 
            ....

        -> HOW TO ABSTRACT IT THE CONCRETE PATTERNS INTO GENERAL PATTERNS ? 
            ....

        -> HOW TO PROVE THAT THE ABSTRACT PATTERN IS APPLICABLE TO SOME RANDOM FIELDS ? 
            ....
