    ABSTRACT:

	PARAMETERIZE:  
        this is the idea where you go from concrete to abstract
        if you already have/implement a concrete solution and now you want to abstract it  
        -> WRAP IT IN A BOX with some parameter sticking out
        try to paramterize it  
        use it as a black box with some input sticking out 

        -> this also applies to parametric design 
            -> design a concrete structure  
            -> parameterize some of the aspect of the structure to create a dynamic structure with different combination of measurements

MY FRAMEWORKS: 
    THINGS YOU NEED TO KNOW BEFORE CHOOSING AMONG TOOLS (DEDUCE FROM 7DB7W): 
        Learn to make choice given:
            + particular needs  
            + resource at hand 
                understand your options: 
                    -> good, bad options 
                    -> Gets your hand dirty to figure out these questions -> understand the options
                        + What TYPE of TOOL is this ?
                        + What the REASON it created ? 
                            -> the kind of problems they best suited 
                        + How to USE it ? 
                        + What makes it UNIQUE ? 
                            -> understanding the: 
                                + capabilities 
                                + constraints 
                                -> help you pick the right tool for the job 

        The questions to ask is: 
            Should i use this to ... ?
            not Can i ....
            -> the questions is less about the solutions is complete fit with your problem
                but rather it's the best fit given your:
                    + problem space
                    + usage pattern 
                    + available resources 

        Instead of pure dominance of any particular strategy: 
            -> we'll see increasingly SPECIALIZED SOLUTION
            -> each suited for a particular (can be overlapped) SET OF IDEAL PROBLEM SPACE 

        -> TEST: USE THIS FRAMEWORK TO UNDERSTAND THE NATURE DATA STRUCTURES AND ALGORITHMS 

    GOOD ENOUGH PHILOSOPHY: 
        Things won't be perfect given the time and technology we currently having 
        Use the thing that is a cut-down version rather than waiting for a perfect to come 
        -> Try to apply the current knowledge 
            (even though it's not perfect match for everything or even well thought out -> know when the stop researching and actually use the knowledge) 
            then refines it afterwards (involve the users in the trade-offs) 


    A MASTER PLAN TO SOLVE PROBLEMS (which should counter your weaknesses in problem solving):
        ....

RANDOM QUOTES (that should be added to some topic):
    Things in life happens in (solution) pattern, a lot of patterns applies to almost every aspect of our lives (economics, decisions, coding, math, ...)
        -> learning general patterns can help you solve most of the problems in most aspect of life
        -> a good language to learning these patterns is Mathematics
        -> Mathematics give you: 
            + an abstract representation of the patterns 
            + the tools:
                + to prove the correctness of the patterns 
                + to predicts the outcome of the patterns
                + to create new patterns 
                + to check the similarity between different fields then apply the same pattern to solve them (Category theory ??)
        -> Able to ABSTRACTLY RECOGINIZE PATTERNS is one of the most powerful things ever (along with all the tools/operations you can apply to the patterns (deduce new patterns, ...))

    -> Question: 
        -> WHAT ARE THE PROPERTIES THAT WE CAN USE TO IDENTIFY PATTERNS ? 
            vd: the similarity of the rules of managing between finantial portfolio and technical portfolio is almost 1 to 1 
            ....

        -> HOW TO ABSTRACT IT THE CONCRETE PATTERNS INTO GENERAL PATTERNS ? 
            ....

        -> HOW TO PROVE THAT THE ABSTRACT PATTERN IS APPLICABLE TO SOME RANDOM FIELDS ? (Mathematically?)
            ....

        -> Does category theory is the answers to all of these questions ?? 
            Category theory is more about how we structure knowledge rather than how knowledge actually are,
            focus on relation (morphism), not content (object)  
            ->  prove things using relation between them so the actual object does not matter 
                as long as the foundation relationship between them holds  
            ....
