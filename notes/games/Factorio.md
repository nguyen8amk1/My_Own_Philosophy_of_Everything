# FACTORIO
a game that could potentially help me better at programming :))

Things need to do 
    + Explore area 
    + Harvest resource 
    + Automate the production of items 

Resources: 
    + Gear
    + Iron ore 
    + Stone 

You can craft your items from resources:  
    + Smelter -> melting iron ore into metal 
        input: 
            + ore: iron ore, copper ore
            + fuel: coal, wood 
        output: metal 

    + Burner mining drill: -> mine raw material from deposit (mo)
        input: 
            fuel
        output:
            raw material: vd(ore, coal, ...)

    + Wooden chest:  
        -> Auto collect the resource from the Burner mining drill

    + Iron chest:  

    + Inserter: 
        they can: 
            + insert  
            + unload 
            item, from:
                + structures  
                + belts
                + containers

        they can be used automatically feed the fual to the machines

        with combination of:
            + bus line 
            + buffer 

Plan: 
    fual will be the constant the stream of
