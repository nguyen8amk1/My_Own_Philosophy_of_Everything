# ABSTRACTING WORDS PROBLEM
## Applying Levels of Abstraction to Mathematics Word Problems 
    Ideas: applying level of abstraction framework from CS to math 
    Background: 
        + Levels of Abstraction in Computer Science Education: 
            Abstraction: 
                a process, a strategy and results of REDUCING DETAIL 
                to FOCUS ON CONCEPTS relevant to understanding and solving problems

            The focus of computer science: 
                NOT on CREATING or USING abstraction at a PARTICULAR LEVEL 
                but be able to :
                    + MOVE among DIFFERENT LEVELS of abstraction 
                    + CHOOSE the RIGHT LEVEL that is USEFUL for the particular STAGE of problem solving

            3 common patterns that student uasually use when problem solving: 
                + Thinking in terms of specific solution (thinking in term of How, rather than What)
                    -> Thinking as HOW to solve rather than WHAT need to be done in general 
                + REFORMULATE the problems in FAMILAR TERMS 
                + Think of ONE PARTICULAR ELEMENT of a set, rather than the whole set
                    -> losing:
                        + sights of the features of the set 
                        + WHY that particular element fits into the set 

                -> Unconciously MOVE to the LOWER level abstraction 

            Moves to lower level of abstraction:
                can ofen be a PRODUCTIVE PROBLEM SOLVING TECHNIQUES
                BUT: can become PROBLEMATIC 
                    if NOT SHIFT back to higher level of abstraction at APPROPRIATE TIME

            -> Issue: LACK OF ATTENTION TO CONTEXT 

            High Level: broader scope, less detail 
            Low Level: narrower scope, more detail 

            vd: 
                High level (Concept): 
                    Focus on: 
                        What need to be done -> Broad scope 
                    not How to go about it (less details)

                Low Level (Process): 
                    Focus on:  
                        How to do (more details)
                    Not WHY it needs to be done (narrow scope)
                ---------

                High Level (Unfamiliar problem)
                    Attention to: 
                        MEANING of the problem
                    Not how to solve it 

                Low level (Familiar Problem)
                    Attention to:
                        method of solving the problem 
                    Not it MEANING in the CONTEXT

                ---------

                High Level (Full set): 
                    Focus on: 
                        ALL ELEMENTS of the sets (broad scope)
                    But only their ESSENTIAL FEATURES (less detail)

                Low Level (Single element): 
                    Focus on: 
                        details of one example (more detail)
                    But not in RELATIONSHIP to set (narrow scope)

                ---------

                High Level (Contextualized word problem): 
                    Includes: 
                        information about problem context (broad scope)
                    But NO EXPLICIT information about HOW TO SOLVE the problem  (less detail)

                Low Level (Decontextualized arithmetic): 
                    Provides: 
                        direction on what to do (more detail)

                    But not how the result should be interpreted (narrow scope)

                
                    
        + Word Problems and Lack of attention to context 

    A Framework for Teaching Abstraction: 
        Abstraction hierarchy: 
            + problem level: 
                the problem is considered as its OWN ENTITY 
                with ATTRIBUTES such as: 
                    + solvability: 
                    + complexity: 

            + object level: 
                the SOLUTION TO THE PROGRAM in the form of an algorithm is considered as its own Entity ?? 

            + program level: 
                the solution is considered as an algorithm in an programming language 

            + execution level: 
                problem solution is running

        -> Student tends to operate at Object, Program level 
        without attending to Problem, Execution level

        -> Student should be TAUGHT how to MOVE AMONG ALL 4 LEVELS
        -> Need to develop 4 skills: 
            1. DIFFERENTIATE between levels of abstraction 
            2. Consciously and freely MOVE between levels of abstraction 
            3. DECIDE the LEVEL of abstraction at which is most comfortable and appropriate 
            to work during each PHASE of problem solving 
            4. Use SUCCESSIVE REFINEMENTS of abstraction ? 
                -> successive refinements: improving the abstraction without changing the output ?? 

        -> Guide lines: 
            + persistent, precise about:
                consistently and cleary DISTINGUISHING among LEVELS.
            + Use LANGUAGE CUES as an aid in DISTINGUISHING between levels
                vd: RESTRICT "programming constructs" to the Program and Execution levels
            + Move from HIGH TO LOW level (1 direction -> high to low): 
                rather than from LOW TO HIGH
            + Explicit and Reflective(Thoughful): 
                -> LOOK BACK to your own PROCESSES 
                   CONSIDER the LEVELS of abstraction USED
