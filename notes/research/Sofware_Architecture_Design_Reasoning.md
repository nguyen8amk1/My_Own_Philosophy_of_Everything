# SOFTWARE ARCHITECTURE DESIGN REASONING 
notes from this research: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228768552_Software_Architecture_Design_Reasoning

## Abstract: 
    Currently there are NO SYSTEMATIC DESIGN REASONING for software architecture 
    Propose: a DESIGN REASONING PROCESS to help design with features that are:
        + cross-cutting 
        + diversified

## Introduction: 
    There are NO COMMONLY ACCEPTED PRACTICES in the industry 
    to carry out the systematic design reasoning 

    Architects often RELY on their:
        + EXPERIENCE 
        + INTUITION 
        -> mostly learned on the job
        -> difficult to teach and articulate(boc tach)
    when making decisions
    -> Unstructured Decision AFFECT the DESIGN QUALITY
    -> These knowledge related to DESIGN RATIONALE

    Design rationale are explicit documention that characterized in 2 ways:
        + Listing the reasons for:
            + making a decision 
            + choosing a solution 

        + Explaining relationships between:
            + a solution 
            + the context of that solution 

    -> EXTERNALIZE design reasoning -> improve"
        + decision making 
        + capture documented evidence for design verification and system maintenance.  

    A well-designed architecture should be JUSTIFIABLE through sound and logical DESIGN RATIONALE. 

    There are many METHODS for design: 
        + ARGUMENTATION-Based Methods (1958):
            Goal: represent DESIGN DELIBERATION.
            Examples: IBIS, DRL, QOC.
            Limitation: DIFFICULTY in CAPTURING DESIGN RATIONALE.

        + TEMPLATE-Based Approaches:
            Goal: AID design reasoning capture.

            Limitation: LIMITED SUPPORT for RELATING: 
                + design decisions
                + it's contexts

    Note: 
        Design deliberation:
            process of considering various:
                + aspects: 
                    exploring alternatives
                + goals, 
                    clarifying goals, analyzing requirements
                + constraints 
                    considering trade-offs
            -> arrive at WELL-INFORMED DESIGN CHOICES, documented for future reference.

## Software Architecture Design Reasoning: 
    Simple Reasoning model, comprises: 
        + inputs 
        + decisions 
        + outputs
