    What do I mean by combinatorial thinking?
    Mani Rezaie, Zahra Gooya*

## Abstract: 
    to learn combinatorial concepts require COMBINATORIAL THINKING
    -> categorize 4 levels of understanding combinatorial thinking: 
        1. INVESTIGATING some cases
        2. how am i SURE that i have counted all the cases
        3. systematically GENERATING all cases 
        4. CHANGING the problem INTO ANOTHER combinatorial problem 
            and  understanding COMBINATORIAL REASONING
## Levels: 

1. Investigating "some cases": 
    find "all cases" using "Multiplication Principle"
2. How am i SURE that i have counted all the cases: 
    .....
