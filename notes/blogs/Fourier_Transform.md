notes from this blog: https://betterexplained.com/articles/an-interactive-guide-to-the-fourier-transform/

Metaphor: 
    What does the Fourier Transform do? 
        Input: smoothie, 
        Output: the recipe
    How? 
        Run the smoothie through FILTERS to EXTRACT each INGREDIENT.
    Why? 
        RECIPES are EASIER to:
            + analyze
            + compare 
            + modify 
        than the smoothie itself.

    How do we GET the smoothie BACK? 
        Blend the ingredients.
