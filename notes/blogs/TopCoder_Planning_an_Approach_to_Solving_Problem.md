## Goal: 
    develop a SOLID PLAN to tackle the problems effectively.
        involve a mix of: 
            + calculations
            + intuition
            + creativity 
            + luck :v 

## Pattern Mining Pitfall: 
    Pattern recognition is helpful 
    BUT rely solely on it is risky/dangerous.  
    -> lead to MISJUDGE a problem, when it unique from other patterns   

## Coding Kata:  
    SOLVING a problem MULTIPLE TIMES 
    to UNDERSTAND and REFINE your APPROACH 
    -> Practice and refine your problem-solving skills, 
    NOT just FOCUS on getting the CORRECT SOLUTION. 

## Approach tactics: 
    understand WHEN TO USE, HOW TO APPLY variety of approaches: 
        + dynamic programming 
        + greedy 
        + ... 
    -> DON'T try to FIT EVERY PROBLEM into a specific category. 

## Breaking Down A Problem: 
    Divide the problem into smaller parts 
    ... 
    [Think like a programmer](../books/Think_Like_a_Programmer.md)

## Plan to Debug: 
    identify: 
        + potential issues 
        + stress points (heavy calculation part, integer overflow, ...)
        in your code 
    -> help you to debug faster 

## Atomic code: 
    atomic: 
        code can't be broken down further 
    some section of the code can be atomic 
    -> standard library are atomic 

## Analyzing stuck points 
    When stuck 
    -> 
        TAKE a step back 
        REEVALUATE your APPROACH 
        Consider whether should BREAK UP the tasks DIFFERENTLY 

## Tips -----
## Manipulating the Problem Domain: 
    transforming the problem domain into a more convenient form 
        -> gain more knowledge about the problem and simplify calculations. 

## Unwinding the Definitions: 
    When encounter UNFAMILIAR TERMS or CONCEPTS: 
        -> think about how you would CODE those DEFINITIONS

## Understand SUBPROBLEM and their RELATIONSHIP
