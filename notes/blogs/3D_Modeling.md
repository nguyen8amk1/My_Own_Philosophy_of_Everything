# 3D MODELING BASICS
notes from this blog: https://www.instructables.com/Intro-to-3D-Modeling/

## Start with basic shapes: 
    + Sketches: 2d shapes that can be EXTRUDE into 3d   
    + Simple 3d primitives: blocks, cylindes, spheres,...

## File types: 
    3D Software can have different file types: 
    vd: 
        Part file: the 3d design of a single part  
        Assembly file: assemblies combinations of parts 
        Drawing file: ... 

## Design environment: 
    In the center, use to: 
        + view 
        + edit 
        your CAD files 

    The TOOLS to MANIPULATE THE FILES are located AROUND THE EDGES 

## Viewing tool: 
    -> VIEW your model in DIFFERENT ORIENTATION

    You can: 
        + Rotate
        + Pan 
        + Zoom 

        + Set the viewing angle normal to a specific plane 

    -> Focus your window to certain aspect of the design if you are working on them.

    Also Allow: 
        + change the background
        + perspective 
        + lighting
