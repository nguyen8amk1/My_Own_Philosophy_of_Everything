# MODEL THINKING
notes from this course: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCwDy_ijIfg

## Model thinking:
    PATTERN OF THINKING that focuses on MENTAL MODELS 
    that are ABSTRACTION of REALITY
    and used to UNDERSTAND and EXPLAIN how the world works 

## Reason to learn: 
    1. Intelligent Citizen of the World 
    2. Clearer Thinker
    3. Understand and Use Data
    4. Decide, Strategize, Design 

## Section Structure: 
    + The Model: 
        + Assumptions 
        + Results
        + Applications
    + Technical details:
        + Measures, Proofs (Mathematically)
        + Practice problems

## Fertility(ability to reproduce -> does these models can apply many circumstances)
The best combination is: Models + Experience 
Quote: "Models are mostly wrong, but some are useful" 

The person who KNOWS BEST is the one who knows lots of FORMAL MODELS 
    -> not just know only 1 model, but many of them -> to model a problem in different perspective -> better accuracy   


# How Model thinking makes our thinking CLEARER: 
    Name the parts: the properties that we actually care about -> abstract things out   
    Identify relationships (between the parts): 
    Work through Logic: 
    Inductively explore: experiment with different strategies
    Understand Class of Outcome: 
        + Equilibrium 
        + Cycle
        + Random
        + Complex 
        
    Identify Logical Boundaries: 
        The CORRECTNESS of statements depends on CONDITION they happens 

# Use, Understand DATA with Model: 
    + UNDERSTAND Patterns: 
    + PREDICT points:
