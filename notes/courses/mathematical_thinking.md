# MATHEMATICAL THINKING
learning from this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LN7cCW1rSsI 

Stresses on the:
   + HOW 
   + WHY 
    -> you get to the right answer 
    rather than just matching a problem to a defined form (since that won't work most of the time in the real world)

Background reading: 
    Mathematic is the science of patterns 
        vd: 
            Arithmetic and number theory: PATTERNS of NUMBER and COUNTING
            Geometric: patterns of shape 
            Calculus: patterns of motion 
            Logic: patterns of reasoning 
            Probability: patterns of chances 

    Mathematical notation is just a REPRESENTATION of math, it's not the Mathematic itself:
        it's like MUSIC SHEET is NOT MUSIC  
            -> the sound that played from that sheet is Music 
        -> IT'S ABOUT THE EXECUTATION OF THE REPRESENTATION 

        -> Mathematic use abstract notation because of the ABSTRACT NATURE of the patterns 
            -> it's the best mean to represent math, that's it 

    Mathematic is not just about computation/calculation
    but it more about:
        + properties 
        + behaviours
        + relationships
        vd: a function is not a formula
           -> it's any rules that produces new number from old  
           -> concernstrate on WHAT THE FUNCTION DOES ? in terms of: input, output behaviours

    Prepare for MENTAL TOOLS for entering and thinking mathematically 

    There are 2 types of mathematical skills: 
        1. get an already formulated problem, find solution
        2. take a new problem:
            identify and describe key features of the problem mathematically  
            use that mathematical description to analyze the problem in a precise fashion

        the 2nd type is better, way more powerful 
            -> can:
                + adapt old methods in new situations 
                + develop new methods 

    -> LEARNING TO THINK IN ANOTHER WAY IS WAY HARDER THAN LEARNING A NEW TECHNIQUES 

The language use in math is very contraint and precise 
    -> precise statement on mathematical objects (vd: integers, reals, sets, functions,...)
    every statement is one of 4 TYPES:
        Object a has property P 
        Every object of type T has property P 
        There is an object of type T having property P 
        If statement A, then statement B

    or COMBINATION of them using COMBINATORS (connecting words): 
        + and
            -> makes things LESS likely to happens
            since more conditions have to be satistify 
        + or 
            -> make things MORE likely to happens
            since things can happen one way or another 
        + not

        + implies 
            vd: A implies B 

            -> and, or, not doesn't require a relationship between 2 statement 
                -> purely in terms of truth and falsity 
            -> implies does, involves causality (nhan qua) 

            -> implication has 2 parts:
                + truth: we care about this part 
                    -> THE (MATERIAL) CONDITIONAL 
                    -> use '=>' symbol
                + causation(nhan qua): we don't care about this :v 

            -> vd: A => B : the truth part of A implies B (not the whole thing, cause we ditch the causation part)
                antecedent(tien su) => consequent(he qua)

            -> We don't care about the meaning, relation between A and B
            -> WE ONLY CARE ABOUT THE TRUTH/FALSE of them to make a conclusion 
            -> WHETHER THE A AND B HAVE REAL RELATION IN MEANING OR NOT -> THE CONDTION STILL DEFINED(EXIST)

        + equivalent 
            -> only take the part we needed (just like with implies, takes conditional)
                -> equivalent takes BICONDITIONAL
            -> Two statements A, B are said to be (logically) equivalent if each implies the other
                -> A <=> B same as (A => B) and (B => A)

        + for all 
        + there exists 
        -> combinations are commutitive 
        logical connections based on truth, not the statement content, meaning, or anything else, just truth (true/false)

    -> formal logic ?? 


The correctness of statement is not shown through experiments, testing,...
    -> using proves
    -> in order to do proves
    -> we need to UNDERSTAND EXACTLY what the problem is stated

You need Mathematical Techniques when Mathematical Thinking alone doesn't work
