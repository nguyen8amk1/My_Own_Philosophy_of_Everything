## What is Calculus:
    -> Mathematical study of CONTINUOUS CHANGE
    -> have 2 branches: 
        + Differential calculus: focus of Calculus I 
            -> The study of RATE of CHANGE
            -> calculate DERIVATE using DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS 

        + Integral calculus: focus of Calculus II
