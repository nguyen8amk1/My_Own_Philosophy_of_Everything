# CONCEPTS, TECHNIQUES, MODELS OF COMPUTER PROGRAMMING 
notes from book: CONCEPTS, TECHNIQUES and MODELS of COMPUTER PROGRAMMING, by PETER VAN ROY and SEIF HARIDI 
(i have physical books :) ) 

# PREFACE: 
    Study PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES as a WAY to LEARN COMPUTER PROGRAMMING: 
        -> give LITTLE INSIGHT into programming as a UNIFIED DISCIPLINE. 
            since there are so MANY PARADIGMS 

    -> We should FOCUS on: 
        + PROGRAMMING CONCEPTS
        + TECHNIQUES in USING those CONCEPTS
        NOT on PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES

    CONCEPTS ORGANIZED in terms of COMPUTATION MODELS: 

        COMPUTATION MODEL: formal SYSTEM that DEFINES HOW COMPUTATION ARE DONE.
            MODELS are DEFINED in terms of CONCEPTS that are IMPORTANT to programmers, such as: 
                + Data types 
                + Operations
                + Programming language

            Each MODEL have it's own SET of TECHNIQUES for: 
                + PROGRAMMING 
                + REASONING 

        *"COMPUTATIONAL MODEL" is more CONCRETE and WELL DEFINED than "PROGRAMMING PARADIGM" 
        

    WHAT programmers NEED: 
        + Programming TECHNIQUES 
        + Design PRINCIPLES 

        made possible by COMPUTATION MODELS
