# DESIGN THINKING 
notes from the book: DESIGN THINKING FOR TECH 

Design thinking definition: 
    the key is to REPLACE our FOCUS: 
        from: the PROBLEM 
        to: the PEOPLE in the middle of that problem 
        -> HUMANIZE THE PROBLEM
    -> so we can move:
        from: trying to deliver perfection
        to: incrementally solving tough problems at face

    ** Important key of solving difficult problem:
        -> HOW MANY IDEAS WE CAN BRING TO LIGHT
