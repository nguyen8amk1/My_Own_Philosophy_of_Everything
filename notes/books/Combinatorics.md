# COMBINATORICS: TOPICS, TECHNIQUES AND ALGORITHMS

## What is Combinatorics: 
    Combinatorics: 
        the art of ARRANGING objects 
        ACCORDING to specified RULEs.

        -> We want to know if: 
            + a PARTICULAR ARRAGEMENT is POSSIBLE at all 
            + how many DIFFERENT WAYS it can be done 

        If the rules are simple 
            -> the EXISTING OF ARRANGEMENT is CLEAR -> CONCERNTRATE on the COUNTING problem 
        If the rules are complex:
            -> it may NOT BE CLEAR whether the arragement is POSSIBLE at all. 

    Why combinatorics is hard: 
        + BROAD rather than DEEP: it stretchs into all corners of mathematics  
        + it's about TECHNIQUEs rather than RESULTs

    An Algorithm ressembles a theorm in that it requires a proof 
        (NOT the proof of the ALGORITHM itself, 
        BUT proof that the algorithm DOES WHAT IT CLAIMED to do)

    Notes: 
        Chapter 3 is the MOST IMPORTANT -> have to READ ALL of it
            other chapters things can be left out 

        Each chapter have the scope indication: 
            + topics: 
                -> specifying results or constructions
            + techniques: 
                -> wider applicability, general methods  
            + algorithms
            + cross-references
                -> pinpoint at least some OCCURENCES of the material IN OTHER CHAPTERS.

        An important part of Combinatorics today is: the algorithmic side 
            -> Prove that some exists but also know HOW TO CONSTRUCT it ?
