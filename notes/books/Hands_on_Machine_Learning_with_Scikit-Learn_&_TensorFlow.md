"This book is a great INTRODUCTION to the THEORY and PRACTICE of SOLVING PROBLEMS WITH NEURAL NETWORK"
    note: not theory and practice of NEURAL NETWORK (but SOLVING PROBLEMS WITH NEURAL NETWORK)
## PREFACE
### Objective and Approach
    + Goals: 
        give you: 
            + concepts 
            + intuition 
            + tools 
            to implement PROGRAMS CAPABLE OF LEARNING FROM DATA.
    + 2 Frameworks: 
        + Scikit-Learn: 
            -> easy to use 
            -> implements many Machine Learning algorithms efficiently 
        + TensorFlow: 
            -> makes it POSSIBLE to TRAIN and run very LARGE NEURAL NETWORKS efficiently 
            across thousands of multi-GPU servers.
    
### Prerequisites: 
    familiar with: 
    + NumPy
    + Pandas
    + Matplotlib

### Roadmap: 
    2 Parts: 
        + Part 1: The Fundamentals of Machine Learning (Uses Scikit-Learn): 
            + What is Machine Learning? 
            + What PROBLEMS does it try to solve ? 
            + What are the:
                + main CATEGORIES 
                + Fundamnental CONCEPTS 
            of Machine Learning systems ?

            + MAIN STEPS in a typical Machine Learning Project 

            + Learning by FITTING a MODEL to DATA.

            + OPTIMIZING a COST FUNCTION.

            + Handling data
              Cleaning data
              Preparing data

            + Selecting and engineering FEATURES
            + Selecting a MODEL and TUNING HYPERPARAMETERS using cross-validation 
    
            + Main CHALLENGES of Machine Learning:
                + underfitting
                + overfitting

            + REDUCING the DIMENTIONALITY of the training data.

            + Most common learning algorithms: 
                + Linear, Polynomial Regression
                + Logistic Regression
                + K-Nearest Neighbors
                + Support Vector Machines
                + Decision Trees
                + Random Forests
                + Ensemble Methods 

        + Part 2: Neural Networks and Deep Learning (uses TensorFlow): 
            + What are neural nets  ? 
            + What are neural nets GOOD FOR ? 

            + BUILDING and TRANING neural nets using TENSORFLOW

            + Most IMPORTANT neural net ARCHITECTURE:  
                + feedforward neural nets
                + convolutional nets
                + long short-term memory (LSTM) nets
                + autoencoders

            + TECHNIQUES for TRAINING deep neural nets. 
            + SCALING neural networks for HUGE DATASETS.

            + Reinforcement learning.
