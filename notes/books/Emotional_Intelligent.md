# EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENT

## Introduction: 
    Emotional Inteligent: new way of thinking about the INGREDIENTS of life success.  
        -> explores of how emotion regulated(dieu khien) in the brain.

    SEL (social and emotional learning) teach (from easy to hard):
        + RECOGINIZE and accurately LABEL their EMOTIONS.
            -> HOW those EMOTIONS LEAD them to ACT. 
        + IDENTIFY the NONVERBAL CLUES to how someone else FEELS. 
        + ANALYZE:
            + what creates STRESS for them. 
            + what MOTIVATES their best PERFORMANCES.
        + LISTENING, TALKING in ways that:
            + RESOLVE conflicts, instead of escalating them 
            + NEGOTIATING for win-win solutions
            
        -> also lead to increase in: 
            + attention    
            + working memory 
            -> the keyrole in the benefits of SEL: is neuroplasticity (the shaping of the brain through the repeated experiences)

    IQ is a prediction in excelent for the cognitive skills to work at a position.
    EQ is a prediction in excelent for who will be the LEADER in the pool of high IQs  

    -> The HIGHER THE POSITION the lower the constraints of IQ 
    -> High IQ is a stronger prediction in excelent for lower-rung job

    Emotional competence: 
        shows HOW MUCH of that POTENTIAL WE have MASTERED in ways 
        that TRANSLATE into on-the-job CAPABILITIES
        -> require EI FUNDAMENTALS.
