# EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENT

## Introduction: 
    Emotional Inteligent: new way of thinking about the INGREDIENTS of life success.  
        -> explores of how emotion regulated(dieu khien) in the brain.

    SEL (social and emotional learning) teach (from easy to hard):
        + RECOGINIZE and accurately LABEL their EMOTIONS.
            -> HOW those EMOTIONS LEAD them to ACT. 
        + IDENTIFY the NONVERBAL CLUES to how someone else FEELS. 
        + ANALYZE:
            + what creates STRESS for them. 
            + what MOTIVATES their best PERFORMANCES.
        + LISTENING, TALKING in ways that:
            + RESOLVE conflicts, instead of escalating them 
            + NEGOTIATING for win-win solutions
            
        -> also lead to increase in: 
            + attention    
            + working memory 
            -> the keyrole in the benefits of SEL: is neuroplasticity (the shaping of the brain through the repeated experiences)

    IQ is a prediction in excelent for the cognitive skills to work at a position.
    EQ is a prediction in excelent for who will be the LEADER in the pool of high IQs  

    -> The HIGHER THE POSITION the lower the constraints of IQ 
    -> High IQ is a stronger prediction in excelent for lower-rung job

    Emotional competence: 
        shows HOW MUCH of that POTENTIAL WE have MASTERED in ways 
        that TRANSLATE into on-the-job CAPABILITIES
        -> require EI FUNDAMENTALS.

## Quote: 
    Anyone can become angry -> EASY 

    But to be angry:
        + with the right PERSON
        + to the right DEGREE
        + at the right TIME
        + for the right PURPOSE 
        + in the right WAY 

        -> NOT EASY

    EMPATHY (cam thong) is the root of Altruism(long vi tha)  
        -> the ability to READ EMOTIONS in others  
        -> can't read -> no caring   

    -> 2 Moral stances: 
        + Self-restraint (tu chu)
        + Compassion (long trac an)

        + self-control 
        + empathy 
        + listening
        + resolving conflicts 
        + cooperation 

    Questions: 
        How can we manage our emotional life with intelligence ? 
        Passions(emotions), when well excercised  have wisdom -> guide our thinking, values, survival 
            BUT can easily go in the wrong direction.

## Notes: 
    -> Emotions have not inherently bad, 
        BUT what MATTER is whether they are:
            + APPROPRIATE to the SITUATION
            + HOW they are EXPRESSED

    -> It's not about having emotions or not 
        but about USING them in a BALANCED and VIRTUOS(co dao duc) ways

## What are emotions for ??
    Our EMOTIONS GUIDE us when dealing with TASKS 
    that are TOO IMPORTANT to DECIDE using INTELLECT alone 
    vd: 
        + danger
        + painful loss 
        + presisting toward a goal despite frustrations
        + bonding with a mate
        + building a family 

    Each EMOTIONS POINTS us in a DIRECTION that has WORKED WELL 
    to handle the recurring CHALLENGES of human life.
    
    These EMOTION has become IMPRINTED into our NERVES through out evolutionary.  

    A HUMAN that IGNORES the POWER of EMOTIONS -> SHORT SIGHTED 

    When it comes to shaping our: 
        + decisions
        + actions
        FEELINGS AFFECT AS MUCH and OFTEN MORE than THOUGHT

    When FEELINGS in CHARGES, INTELLIGENCE is daubuoirerach

    Our EMOTIONS (which have evolved over a long period) 
    may have been an EFFECTIVE GUIDE for survival in the PAST. 
    BUT the FAST CHANGES from our modern society OUTPACED the slow process of BIOLOGICAL EVOLUTION. 

    -> Just rely on the innate emotions is no good in developed society 
        -> people create RULES to SUPPRESS some BAD INNATE EMOTIONS (vd: kinh thanh, ...)
