# CHAPTER 2: DECLARATIVE COMPUTATION MODEL 

## Programming encompasses 3 things: 
    1. a COMPUTATION model: 
        -> a formal system that defines: 
            + a language 
            + how SENTENCES of the LANGUAGE (vd: expresssion, statements, ...) 
                are EXECUTED by an ABSTRACT MACHINE 

    2. a SET of:
            + PROGRAMMING TECHNIQUES 
            + DESIGN PRINCIPLES 
            used to WRITE PROGRAMS in the LANGUAGE OF THE COMPUTATION MODEL.  

        or another name: 
            Programming model = a set of <the above> 
        NOTE: 
            A PROGRAMMING model is always BUILT ON TOP of a COMPUTATION model. 

    3. a SET of REASONING TECHNIQUES 
        -> let you REASON ABOUT PROGRAMS  
            -> increase CONFIDENCE that they BEHAVE CORRECTLY
            -> calculate program's EFFICIENCY
