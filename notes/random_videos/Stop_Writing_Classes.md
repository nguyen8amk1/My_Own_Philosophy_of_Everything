# STOP WRITING CLASSES

## Prefer easy things
    + simple is better than complex.
    + FLAT is better than NESTED.  
    + Readability counts
    + If the IMPLEMENTATION is HARD to EXPLAIN -> it's a BAD idea. 
    + If the IMPLEMENTATION is EASY to EXPLAIN -> it's a maybe a GOOD idea. 
    + Don't do hard things in the first place. 

## Sign of Class overuse: 
    Have a class with 2 methods, one of them is the constructor :v 
        -> just use function 

## Namespaces are for PREVENTING NAME COLLISIONS (NOT for creating taxonomies(phan loai))
