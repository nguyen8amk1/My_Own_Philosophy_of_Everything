# COMBINATORICS

## 3 Principles: 
    + Addition: 
        Each choice is a INDEPENDENT/DISTINCT APPROACH to get the task done  
        -> ADD them up to get the TOTAL ways to get to the goal 

    + Multiplication: 
        Break the big task into different SUBTASKs/STEPs (subtask meaning they are NOT INDEPENDENT from each other -> all of subtask have to be done in order to finish the big task)
        each subtasks HAVE A NUMBER OF WAYS to get it done
        -> MULTIPLY them(the number of ways of each subtask) together to get the TOTAL ways to get the big task done 

    + Inclusion-exclusion:
        ....

    -> Addition is high level (different ways)
    -> Multiplication is lower level (substep in each way)

    the questions might have some CONTRAINTS: 
        vd: No repetition is allowed

## Combinatorial Objects: 
    + k-permutation of a set S: 
        -> an ORDERED LIST of exactly k elements of S
        -> not allowed to use any element twice 
        P(n, k): the NUMBER of k-permutation of a set with n elements

    + k-subset of a set S: 
        -> an UNORDERED LIST of exactly k elements of S
        -> not allowed to use any element twice 
        (n k): the NUMBER of k-subsets of a set with n elements

        P(n, k) = (n k)*k! -> (n k) = P(n, k)/k!

# Catalan number: 

IMPORTANT: 
    Catalan numbers ?? 

    -> P(n, k) > (n k)
