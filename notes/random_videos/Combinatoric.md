# COMBINATORICS

## 3 Principles: 
    + Addition: 
        Each choice is a INDEPENDENT/DISTINCT APPROACH to get the task done  
        -> ADD them up to get the TOTAL ways to get to the goal 

    + Multiplication: 
        Break the big task into different SUBTASKs/STEPs (subtask meaning they are NOT INDEPENDENT from each other -> all of subtask have to be done in order to finish the big task)
        each subtasks HAVE A NUMBER OF WAYS to get it done
        -> MULTIPLY them(the number of ways of each subtask) together to get the TOTAL ways to get the big task done 

    + Inclusion-exclusion:
