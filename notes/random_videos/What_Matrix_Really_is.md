# WHAT MATRIX REALLY IS? 
note from this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbtQik_7wTo&ab_channel=Autodidact

LOGICALLY this is how Matrix calculation was invented:
    things evolve downwards:

    1. function:
        1 input
        1 output

    2. function:
        n input
        1 output

    3. function:
        n input
        m output

Linear: 
    ....
    vd: y = ax is linear
        y = ax + by is linear
        y = ax + 2 is not linear

N-M FUNCTION + LINEAR FUNCTION = MATRICES
