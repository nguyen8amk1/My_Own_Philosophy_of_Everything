# FUZZY LOGIC
Computer normally great at deal with a CONCRETE STATEMENT with clear RESULT of TRUE or FALSE 
Human on the other hand normally deal with uncertainty/"fuzzy" like:
    "Does the weather nice today"
    "Does Color A look the same as Color B"
    -> things that are more subjective rather than anything too objective that everyone agrees :v  
    -> rather a RESULT of a statement is 0(false) or 1(true), 
    the RESULT of fuzzy logic is more like a SLIDER FROM 0 to 1  
-> We program computer to deal with uncertainty

-> Basically: 
    Crisp input -> Fuzzify them -> Inference(suy luan, using some predefined rules) -> Crisp output

If dealing with uncertainty without using fuzzy logic 
    -> You have to combine series of if statement in order to accomodate with different thresholds of states
    -> when rule changes -> have to maintain a lot of tangled code in the inference if statement 

-> Using fuzzy logic system -> you don't have to change the code itself, just CHANGE THE RULES that inputed into the INFERENCE MODULE 

QUESTIONS: 
    Fuzzy logic vs Neural Network ??
