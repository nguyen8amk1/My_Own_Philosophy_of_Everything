notes from this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeaD0ZaUJ3Y&ab_channel=SurvivingandThrivinginHigherEducation

Reading paper is a 2 PHASES process:  
    Phase 1: Surveying the paper 
        1. Read the TITLE and KEYWORDS 
        2. Read the ABSTRACT 
        3. Read the CONCLUSIONS

        Stop at any point if you feel don't like it (throw the paper away)

    Phase 2: Read the article 
        1. Look at the TABLEs and FIGUREs (including CAPTIONs): 
            -> This is really WHAT WAS DONE IN THE WORK. 

        2. Read the INTRODUCTION: 
            -> This is the BACKGROUND NEEDED and WHY THE STUDY WAS DONE 

        3. Read the RESULTS and DISCUSSION 
            -> This is the heart of the paper. 

        4. Read the EXPERIMENTAL.
            -> This is HOW THEY DID THE WORK.
            -> This is WHERE YOU WILL LEARN WHAT THE AUTHOR ACTUALLY DO.

    ** Remember to note the research is some system that the notes can be EASILY READ and COLLECTED
