# HOW TO SOLVE WORD PROBLEMS 
notes from this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON7i6Z1a4no
example question: 
    5 years from now, the age of Jacob will be 3 times that of his son.
    5 years ago, the age of Jacob was 7 times that of his son.
    Find their present ages.

    my solution: 
        x = Jacob current age 
        y = Jacob's son current age 

        -> x + 5 = 3*(y + 5)
        -> x - 5 = 7*(y - 5)

        -> x = 40, y = 10

## Things to keep in mind: 
    + Read the questions carefully 
        -> the UNKNOWNS 
            vd: 
                -> jacob current age 
                -> jacob's son current age 
        -> what the RELATIONS/PATTERNS between the UNKNOWNS
            -> represent the RELATION as equations
            relation: 
                5 years from now, the age of Jacob will be 3 times that of his son.
                    -> x + 5 = 3*(y + 5)
                5 years ago, the age of Jacob was 7 times that of his son.
                    -> x - 5 = 7*(y - 5)
