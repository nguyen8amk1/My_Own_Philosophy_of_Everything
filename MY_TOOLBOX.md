        Answer these questions:
            + What is the TYPING MODEL?: 
            + What is the PROGRAMMING MODEL?: 
            + What is the reason it created? (Optional): 
            + How will you INTERACT with it?: 
            + What are the:
                + decision constructs: 
                + core data structures: 
            + What are the CORE FEATURES that make the language UNIQUE ? 

        *Ruby: 
            + What is the PROGRAMMING MODEL?: 
                Pure Object Oriented -> Everything down to a single number is an object 
                unlike Java -> numbers are primitives (don't have properties and methods) -> mixed with procedural 

            + What is the TYPING MODEL?: 
                dynamic-typing: type-checking at run-time
                strongly-typed (not exactly but it behave like one most of the type )
                Duck-typing

                -> the TRADE-OFF that developer have to deal with: 
                    cons: 
                        + can't catch as many errors as static typing  
                    pros: 
                        + Duck-typing: your class DON'T have to inherit from the SAME PARENT 
                        to be USED THE SAME WAY 
                            -> Extremely important when comes to CLEAN OBJECT ORIENTED DESIGN
                            An important mindset in design philosophy is: 
                                code to INTERFACES rather than IMPLEMENTATIONS (@Confuse)
                                -> Duck-typing support very good
                                    -> if an object has PUSH and POP methods -> it can be treated as a STACK 

                -> the WAY TO ATTACK THE PROBLEM: 
                    ....
                -> the WAY THE LANGUAGE WORKS:
